## What is Logic Agent?

Logic Agent is an open-source autonomous agent with one defining characteristic: **there is no pre-built UI.** Every interface the user sees is generated by the agent in real-time.

Ask it to show your team's performance — it doesn't open a dashboard. It reasons about your data, picks the right visualization, generates a live interactive component, connects it to real data, and renders it in a sandboxed viewport. Ask it to approve an action — it generates a contextual approval interface with the relevant details. Ask it anything — it builds the interface to answer it.

Familiar patterns get faster over time. The more you use it, the quicker and cheaper it gets.

### Core Thesis

The agent's output medium IS the interface. There is no dashboard to configure. There is no app to navigate. Every interaction produces a live, interactive, data-connected UI — shaped by what you need, right now. Successful outputs persist and accelerate future ones.

## How It Works

Traditional agents respond with text. Logic Agent responds with **live, interactive, data-connected interfaces.**

The user sees a minimal shell: a prompt input, a viewport, and a status bar. Everything else — every chart, table, form, settings panel, approval dialog — is generated by the agent based on context.

```

Generated interfaces run in an **isolated sandbox** — they can only access data the agent explicitly provisions. A small set of trusted, non-generated elements (authentication, approval controls) render outside the sandbox and cannot be faked by generated content.

The agent connects to your data — or builds the connection if one doesn't exist yet. Connectors and pipelines it creates persist for future use.

### Resilience

Successfully rendered interfaces are **cached locally in the browser**. If the agent or LLM goes down, your most recent interfaces remain accessible and interactive. Logic Agent degrades gracefully — it never goes blank.

### Autonomy

Every agent action is gated by a configurable trust boundary. You control how much autonomy the agent has — from fully supervised to largely autonomous. Low-confidence decisions are always escalated for approval, regardless of the autonomy level.

## Development

Runtime: **Node >= 22** (Bun also supported for TypeScript execution)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logic-agent/logic-agent.git
cd logic-agent
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm logic-agent onboard
```

### Commands

```bash
pnpm logic-agent          # Run CLI
pnpm dev                  # Dev mode
pnpm build                # Build
pnpm test                 # Tests (vitest)
pnpm test:coverage        # Tests with V8 coverage
pnpm check                # Lint + format + typecheck
pnpm tsgo                 # TypeScript checks
pnpm format               # Format check (oxfmt)
pnpm format:fix           # Format fix
```

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a chatbot.** Responds with live interfaces, not text.
- **Not a website builder.** Generates ephemeral, contextual interfaces tied to live data — not apps for deployment elsewhere.
- **Not locked to one LLM.** Model-agnostic with provider failover.
- **Not a framework.** A complete, opinionated agent runtime.
